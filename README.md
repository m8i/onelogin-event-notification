onelogin-event-notification
==========================

Automatically send event notifications from OneLogin to a specified email address.

This super simple script is intended to fill the gap with OneLogin's notification abilities until they build them in to the product.

Currently, if a directory connector goes down, there is no way to be notified of the event.

We are only running this script once an hour in our environment, but we may change that in the future.
